**IN PROGRESS:** In my *ECE 477 Digital System Senior Design* class, my team and I designed and built two smart chess boards that connect to the players smartphones via Bluetooth so two people can play a physical game of chess no matter the distance between them. I specialized in PCB design and Bluetooth communication.
