As part of a Compilers course at Purdue University, I collaborated with a project partner to develop a compiler in Java for a simple programming language that supports scanning and parsing, code generation for assignments, expressions, control statements and functions, register allocation, and pointers. This gave me great experience using Java and version control with Git.
