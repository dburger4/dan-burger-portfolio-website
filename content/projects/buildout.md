Developed a Ruby on Rails RESTful API Web Service as a team of four interns for [Buildout](https://buildout.com/) to integrate Social Media for their customers. After designing the UX on the frontend, brokerages who use Buildout can connect, post to, and get insights with Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and Instagram.
