At [Buildout](https://buildout.com/), I developed a RESTful API Web Service using Ruby on Rails in MacOS that leveraged the APIs of Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and Instagram to integrate them into Buildout. I designed a frontend user experience that connected to our Web Service to allow Buildout users to securely log in, post to, and get insights from their preferred social medias.
