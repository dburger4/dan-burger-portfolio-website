In *ECE 362 Microprocessor Systems and Interfacing*, I programmed an arcade game on an STM32 F0 microcontroller that is playable on a computer terminal with full controls and theme music. My game was called "Busy Diner" where you control a waiter from a top-down view of the restaurant and you collect food items and give them to customers in exchange for money.
