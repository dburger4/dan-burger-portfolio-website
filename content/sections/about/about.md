My hard work in college has allowed me to grow my network and gain professional experinece in the form of two internships. [At Buildout](https://buildout.com/), I built a RESTful API Web Service for Social Media integration with Ruby on Rails. [At Northrop Grumman](https://www.northropgrumman.com/), I researched and integrated Docker containers into the subsystem testing suite and built Docker images for individual tests.

I am the president and a performing member of Purdue's improv group, [The Crazy Monkeys](https://www.crazymonkeyscomedy.com),
and I held a mid teir leadership role in [Boiler Gold Rush](https://www.purdue.edu/orientation/bgr/index.html), Purdue's orientation program.
