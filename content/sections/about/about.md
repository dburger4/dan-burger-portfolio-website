I've spent the past few years as a Software Engineer II at [Lockheed Martin Space](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/capabilities/space.html) supporting a real-time satellite data distribution program. My time there has taught me the importance of well tested, scaleable, and performant code. I quickly became a key contributor with my work on [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) containerized client software, programming in-house developer and test tools, and optimizing our [Elastic stack](https://www.elastic.co/elastic-stack/?ultron=B-Stack-Trials-AMER-US-W&gambit=Stack-ELK-EXT&blade=adwords-s&hulk=paid&Device=c&thor=elk%20stack&gclid=CjwKCAjwt52mBhB5EiwA05YKo_G3QZ1yoQFDE0XB-vpKVgdRUdB3M3myq946g8inN5NLD4FcpCPPTRoCoaQQAvD_BwE)

I earned my bachelor's degree in [Computer Engineering from Purdue University](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECE) and worked internships at [Northrop Grumman](https://www.northropgrumman.com/) and [Buildout](https://www.buildout.com/).

During my free time, you can find me performing in comedy shows (improv and sketch) at [Rise Comedy](https://risecomedy.com/), rollerblading, and running.
